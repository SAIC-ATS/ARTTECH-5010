# SerialFullDuplex

This folder contains an example for two-way communication between a computer and an Arduino..

## Folders

In the `Arduino/SerialFullDuplex` folder, you'll find code to send and receive multiple values to and from the computer.

In the `openFrameworks/SerialFullDuplex` folder, you'll find code to send and receive multiple values to and from the Arduino.

To compile and upload the Arduino example, open the `SerialFullDuplex.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.

To run the openFrameworks code, use the openFrameworks Project Generator to generate the project files and open the project file in the Xcode IDE (or the IDE for your platform).

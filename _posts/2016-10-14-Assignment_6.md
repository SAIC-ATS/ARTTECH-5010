1. Building off of [this week's examples](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-5010/tree/master/Week_06), experiment with particle systems to create a variety of effects.
    - Do at least 2 of the following:
       - Create two different kinds of particles by modifying their look and physical properties.
       - Draw connections between particles that are near other particles.
       - Extend the particle system to work in 3 dimensions.
       - Create external "forces" to make the particles avoid the mouse.
       - Create external "forces" to make the particles be attracted to the mouse.
       - Incorporate typography into your particle system.
       - Make the behavior of the particle change as it ages.

2. Check out these online experiments for [inspiration](https://www.chromeexperiments.com/particles).

3. (optional) If you'd like to dig into particle systems, there is a great reading [here](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-4-particle-systems/).  It isn't using openFrameworks, but the concepts are all the same.

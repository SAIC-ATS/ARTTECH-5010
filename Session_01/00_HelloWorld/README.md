## Description

This is one of the most basic C++ program one can write.

## What does it demonstrate?

- The use of comments to clarify our intent and organize our code `// My comments!`.
- A basic `main()` function, the entry point for launching a program.
- Including advanced features from the standard library via `#include <iostream>`.
- Using output functions such as `std::cout` for displaying our output in terminal.
- Returning successfully from our function using a `return 0;`.

## To Compile and Run

```shell
$ g++ HelloWorld.cpp -o HelloWorld
$ ./HelloWorld
```

## What is the expected output?

```shell
Hello World!
```

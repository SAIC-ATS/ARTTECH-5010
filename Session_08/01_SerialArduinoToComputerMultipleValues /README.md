# SerialArduinoToComputerMultiValues

This folder contains two examples for sending a single value from the Arduino to a computer.

## Folders

In the `Arduino/SerialArduinoToComputerMultiValues` folder, you'll find code to send a multiple values to the computer.

In the `openFrameworks/SerialArduinoToComputerMultiValues` folder, you'll find code to receive a single value from the Arduino.

To compile and upload the Arduino example, open the `SerialArduinoToComputerMultiValues.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.

To run the openFrameworks code, use the openFrameworks Project Generator to generate the project files and open the project file in the Xcode IDE (or the IDE for your platform).

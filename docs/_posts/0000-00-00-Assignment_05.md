1. Review the "mystery" code.  Make sure you understand how `bitRead(...)`, `bitWrite(...)`, `bitClear(...)` and `bitSet(...)` and `bit(...)` works and how `bitRead(...)` is used to determine the output of each LED.

2. Building on the `DebounceDemo` extend the program to do the following:
  - A button press will cycle through four states
      - "OFF"
      - "ON"
      - "Blinking"
      - "Fading up and then down" (and repeat)

3. Building on the `DebounceDemo` create a program to do the following:
  - Upon a button press, an led goes to full brightness then slowly fades to off.
  - If at any point the button is pressed, the brightness immediately goes to full brightness.


4. Reading / Watching
  - Read / Watch [Ohm's Law Intro](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law). introduction](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law) to voltage, current and resistance.
  - Read [this introduction](https://www.sparkfun.com/search/results?term=transistors) to Transistors.
  - Watch [this introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-td7YT-Pums) to Transistors.

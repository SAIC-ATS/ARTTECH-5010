1. Building off of [this week's examples](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-5010/tree/master/Session_08).
  - Specifically, take a look at the [00_SerialArduinoToComputerOneValue](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-5010/tree/master/Session_08/00_SerialArduinoToComputerOneValue) and [01_SerialArduinoToComputerMultipleValues](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-5010/tree/master/Session_08/01_SerialArduinoToComputerMultipleValues) examples for sending data back and forth between Arduino and openFrameworks.
  - Augment your self-portrait to be controlled by input from the Arduino.
  - Modify your self-portrait to receive Serial data from the Arduino.
  - Create an Arduino application that can send _at least_ one button input and _at least_ one analog value (e.g. a potentiometer) that will modify

3. Review Serial Communication
    - What is "serial" communication?
    - What is "parallel" communication?
    - What does it mean for serial communication to be asynchronous?
        - What is an example?
    - What does it mean for serial communication to be synchronous?
        - What is an example?
    - What does UART mean?
    - What are I2C and SPI and when are they used?
    - What is a "logic level" and what are common voltage values for logic levels?
    - Why do we have to specify the communication speed when using UART-style serial communication?
        - What are bauds?
        - What are data bits?
        - What are parity bits?
        - What are stop bits?
    - What are the difference between these four Arduino expressions?
        - `Serial.print("127");`, `Serial.print(127);`, `Serial.println(127);` and `Serial.write(127);`?
        - What are the advantages of using one over the others?
    - What is "ASCII" and why is it used?
    - If you are unsure of the answers any of those questions, look it up or check your notes.  If you are still are unclear post a question to the forum and we'll discuss it.

2. Read: ofBook [OOps!](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/OOPs!.html)

3. (optional) Serial Communication Reading Part 2
    - [SPI](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-peripheral-interface-spi)
    - [I2C](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/i2c)

3. (optional) Supplemental tutorials (for these, you may use Processing or Max/MSP or openFrameworks if you like).
    - [Debounce](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Debounce)
    - [ASCIITable](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ASCIITable)
    - [SerialCallResponse](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/SerialCallResponse)
        - Note, you don't need force resistors for this example.  Simple buttons will suffice.
    - [SerialCallResponseASCII](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/SerialCallResponseASCII)
        - Note, you don't need force resistors for this example.  Simple buttons will suffice.

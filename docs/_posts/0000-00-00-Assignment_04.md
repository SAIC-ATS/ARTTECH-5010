1. Building off of the `03_CylonControllingMultipleLEDs` example, create a sketch that:
   - When the potentiometer is turned all the way clockwise, all 6 LEDs are turned on.
   - When the potentiometer is turned only half way, 3 LEDs are on.
   - When the potentiometer is turned all the way anti-clockwise no LEDs are on.
   - Thus, the number of LEDs should be proportional to amount of voltage read by the analog input.

2. Building off of [this week's examples](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-5010/tree/master/Session_04), attempt to recreate as many of the above LED patterns as you can in less than 2 hours.  Some recommendations:
  - For each pattern attempt to determine the following:
    - What do you observe changing? (e.g. led position? light intensity? timing? fading vs. on / of?)
    - In addition to the array of led brightness values, what other variables will you need to keep track of?
    - How are those variables being modified over time?
  - Make a new sketch for each pattern building from our in-class frameworks.

3. Key questions you are expected to be able to answer after the blinking light project above.
    - Arrays
        - What are arrays and how do you declare them in C++?
        - How do you read elements inside of an array?
        - How do you change or set elements inside of an array?
    - Looping
        - What is a `for`-loop and why might you use one?
        - What are the three pieces of information you need when you are constructing a for loop and what goes inside the curly braces?
          - (i.e. `for( what goes in here? ) { what goes in here? }`  )
    - If you are unsure of the answers any of those questions, look it up or check your notes.  If you are still are unclear post a question to the forum and we'll discuss it.

4. Review Number Representation
    - Watch: [Things - Counting in Binary on your Fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apCLHmPsC68)
    - Remember: There are 10 kinds of people in the world. Those who understand binary and those who don't.
    - [Hexadecimal](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/hexadecimal)
    - Make sure you understand what an [Ascii Table](http://www.asciitable.com/) is.

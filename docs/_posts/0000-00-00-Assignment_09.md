1. Building off of [this week's examples](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-5010/tree/master/Session_09).
    - Specifically, take a look at the updated [00_SerialFullDuplex](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-5010/tree/master/Session_09/00_SerialFullDuplex) example for sending data back and forth between Arduino and openFrameworks.
    - Update last week's homework to include sending data to the Arduino from openFrameworks.
    - Modify your self-portrait to SEND serial data to the Arduino to light up LEDs or control a motor.

2. Read to prep for our discussion of sound!
    - ofBook: [Sound](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/sound.html)
    - Processing Tutorial: [Sound](https://processing.org/tutorials/sound/) _Read through **Tools for sound programming**, but don't focus on the Processing examples._
    - Jonathan Sterne on the implications of [audio technology](http://culturedigitally.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Sterne-2016-Analog-Digital-Keywords-Peters-ed.pdf) in society.
    - Think about sounds as fluid, rather than pitches consonance/dissonance. Read the classic, [Art of Noise](http://www.artype.de/Sammlung/pdf/russolo_noise.pdf).
